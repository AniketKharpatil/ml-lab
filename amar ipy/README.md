# Machine Learning Pracs
## Machine Learning pracs to... study?

### Practical shit
1. Practical 1 - Underfitting and overfitting - just run the cells
2. Practical 2 - Linear regression - just run the cells
3. Practical 3 - Logistic regression - social network dataset
4. Practical 4 
    1. Ensemble Learner - diabetes dataset
    2. Decision tree - Social network ads
5. Practical 5 - SVM - diabetes dataset
6. Practical 6 - DBSCAN - just run the cells
7. Practical 7 - PCA/SVD 
#### few notes for the unexperienced 
- if some module is missing i.e no module found `xyz` then just add `!pip install xyz` at the top of the file. Same have done in practical 7
- ctrl+enter or shift+enter to run cells in ipynb files
- press 'esc' to enter command mode in jupyter 
    - then press dd to delete cells or other shit idk
- remember, just delete the cell that doesn't work, shit doesn't matter anyway
